OpenGL Graphic Primitives

This lab helps us to familiar with all OpenGL Primitives which includes:
- GL_POINTS
- GL_LINES
- GL_LINE_STRIP
- GL_LINE_LOOP
- GL_POLYGON
- GL_TRIANGLES
- GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
- GL_TRIANGLE_FAN
- GL_QUAD_STRIP

Requirements: 

-Create a GLUT window titled Lab1 that is positioned at 100, 100 (upper-left hand corner). Make the window large enough to display ALL of the openGL graphic primitives.

-Create a user-defined init function that clears the viewport to black.

-Create a keyboard callback function that allows the user to type "q" to exit the application.

-Use the reshape callback function discussed in class to handle window events.

-Create a display callback function that draws each graphic primitive using a different color. Points should be drawn with a larger pen size so they are visible. Do not overlap or intersect primitives within the viewport.

Improvements 

- Draw a scene or object using most of the primitives.

- Draw each primitive separately based on user input (let the user scroll through the primitives by hitting a key or the space bar.

- Use vertex colors for smooth-shaded polygons.
